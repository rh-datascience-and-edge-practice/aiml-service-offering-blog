# MLOps Foundation Engagement

## Red Hat AI/ML Service Offerings

In 2021, Red Hat released Red Hat OpenShift Data Science (RHODS) as a Tech Preview (TP) product, available as a managed service offering available on select cloud platforms.  Earlier this year Red Hat officially made RHODS Generally Available (GA), which included releasing support for Red Hat OpenShift Data Science as a self-managed service offering, bringing the data science tools to even more OpenShift users.

With the growing number of Red Hat customers seeking to expand their data science capabilities, the Data Science & Edge Practice at Red Hat has created several consulting service offerings to help meet our customers wherever they are at on their data science journey, the Red Hat OpenShift Data Science Platform Engagement, and the MLOps Foundation Engagement.

The Red Hat OpenShift Data Science Platform Engagement focuses on helping customers get up and running with RHODS and integrate it with their existing enterprise services.  The MLOps Foundation Engagement is designed to help customers that have trained a machine learning model and are hoping to leverage MLOps to move beyond a data science experiment, and to create a production ready ML service.

This article will focus on the Red Hat OpenShift Data Science Platform Engagement, but to learn more about the MLOps Foundation Engagement, see the companion post [here](mlops-foundation.md).
