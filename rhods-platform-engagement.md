# Red Hat AI/ML Service Offerings

In 2021, Red Hat released Red Hat OpenShift Data Science (RHODS) as a Tech Preview (TP) product, available as a managed service offering available on select cloud platforms.  Earlier this year Red Hat officially made RHODS Generally Available (GA), which included releasing support for Red Hat OpenShift Data Science as a self-managed service offering, bringing the data science tools to even more OpenShift users.

With the growing number of Red Hat customers seeking to expand their data science capabilities, the Data Science & Edge Practice at Red Hat has created several consulting service offerings to help meet our customers wherever they are at on their data science journey.
