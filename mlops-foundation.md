# Red Hat AI/ML Service Offerings

In 2021, Red Hat released Red Hat OpenShift Data Science (RHODS) as a Tech Preview (TP) product, available as a managed service offering available on select cloud platforms.  Earlier this year Red Hat officially made RHODS Generally Available (GA), which included releasing support for Red Hat OpenShift Data Science as a self-managed service offering, bringing the data science tools to even more OpenShift users.

With the growing number of Red Hat customers seeking to expand their data science capabilities, the Data Science & Edge Practice at Red Hat has created several consulting service offerings to help meet our customers wherever they are at on their data science journey.

## MLOps Foundation Engagement

The MLOps Foundation Engagement seeks to help customers that have started experimenting with machine learning and have possibly even trained train a machine learning model, but are asking the question of "What do I do now?"

The MLOps Foundation is designed to help customers move out of the experimentation phase and create a robust, production ready machine learning service.

The engagement delivers three key capabilities to help customers to productionize their machine learning models:

* Model to Microservice: Take an existing ML model prototype and deploy it as an API service endpoint.
* CI/CD Automation: Introduce CI/CD automation to with kube-native tooling to help train and release models faster, more often, and with higher confidence.
* Observable Metrics: Create observability into model, application, and business metrics in order to enable actionable decisions and continuous improvement.

In the MLOps Foundation Service Offering, Red Hat will work directly with our customers Data Scientists, Application Developers/ML Engineers, and DevOps Engineers to create a solution that not only meets their specific requirements, bridging the gap between disciplines, and helping to create a repeatable solution for future MLOps efforts.  Red Hat strives to enable our customers to deliver not just their first machine learning model, but future models as well.

The MLOps Foundation is available in a number of different sizing options to help meet specific customer needs and requirements, from a basic PoC to a highly iterative and automated self-training solutions with multiple machine learning models.
