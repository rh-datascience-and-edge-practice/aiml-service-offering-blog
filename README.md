# Red Hat AI/ML Service Offerings

In 2021 (need to check date), Red Hat released Red Hat OpenShift Data Science (RHODS) as a managed service offering available on select cloud platforms.  Earlier this year Red Hat officially released support for Red Hat OpenShift Data Science as a self-managed service offering bringing the data science tools to even OpenShift users.

With the growing number of Red Hat customers seeking to expand their data science capabilities, the Data Science & Edge Practice at Red Hat has created several new consulting service offerings to help meet our customers wherever they are at on their data science journey.

## Red Hat OpenShift Data Science Platform Engagement

The Red Hat OpenShift Data Science Platform Engagement focuses on helping customers get up and running with RHODS quickly, and helping their teams get the most out of it.

The RHODS Platform Engagement starts by helping to standing up the tooling in any environment, from cloud based OpenShift clusters, to fully disconnected on-prem environments.  Additional, the Red Hat team will help to identify any critical integration points in existing systems, or additional tooling needed to meet each customers unique requirements and help to integrate those into the RHODS Platform.

Additional, the Red Hat team will help to assess your Data Science team's unique requirements and deliver custom Jupyter Notebook environments to your team rapidly prototype solutions.

Finally, the Red Hat team will work directly with your teams to help them to get the most out of RHODS and enable your teams for success to maintain the platform moving forward.

The Red Hat OpenShift Data Science Platform Engagement is availble in a number of different sizing options to meet specific customer needs including PoC and dev cluster setup, or larger multi-cluster setups

## MLOps Foundation Engagement

The MLOps Foundation Engagement seeks to help customers that have started experimenting with machine learning and have possibly even trained train a machine learning model, but are asking the question of "What do I do now?"

The MLOps Foundation is designed to help customers move out of the experimentation phase and create a robust, production ready machine learning service.

The engagement delivers three key capabilities to help customers to productionize their machine learning models:

* Model to Microservice: Take an existing ML model prototype and deploy it as an API service endpoint.
* CI/CD Automation: Introduce CI/CD automation to with kube-native tooling to help train and release models faster, more often, and with higher confidence.
* Observable Metrics: Create observability into model, application, and business metrics in order to enable actionable decisions and continuous improvement.

In the MLOps Foundation Service Offering, Red Hat will work directly with our customers Data Scientists, Application Developers/ML Engineers, and DevOps Engineers to create a solution that not only meets their specific requirements, bridging the gap between disciplines, and helping to create a repeatable solution for future MLOps efforts.  Red Hat strives to enable our customers to deliver not just their first machine learning model, but future models as well.

The MLOps Foundation is available in a number of different sizing options to help meet specific customer needs and requirements, from a basic PoC to a highly iterative and automated self-training solutions with multiple machine learning models.
